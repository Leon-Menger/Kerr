# Kerr
A small but potent Kerr-metric Raytracer that I wrote during a lecture on "Black Holes and Neutron Stars - Theory and Observation" by Dr. C. Fromm and Dr. R. Gold at the Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main.

The code is meant for educational purposes and is not efficient but sure alot of fun to modify and use.
Moularity and easy access are main goals for this project so evertyhing is well documented and all sources can be found within the code.

The paper we were using is written by Pu et al. and can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02063.pdf.

Another interesting read is the documentation of scipys "solve_ivp" method as it allows for easy event, step size and integration method implementation: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html

The GIF that can be found in the repo was created by varying the oberver angle theta from 90 to 180 and then rotating the pictures for a half turn of the camera.
